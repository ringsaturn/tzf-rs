# tzf-rs: a fast timezone finder for Rust. [![Rust](https://github.com/ringsaturn/tzf-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ringsaturn/tzf-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/tzf-rs/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tzf-rs)

**NOTE**: this package use a simplified shape data so not so accurate around
border.

## Build options

By default, the binary is built as well. If you don't want/need it, then build
like this:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

Or add in the below way:

```bash
cargo add tzf-rs --no-default-features
```

## Best practice

It's expensive to init tzf-rs's Finder/FuzzyFinder/DefaultFinder, please
consider reuse it or as a global var. Below is a global var example:

```rust
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use tzf_rs::DefaultFinder;

lazy_static! {
    static ref FINDER: DefaultFinder = DefaultFinder::new();
}

fn main() {
    print!("{:?}\n", FINDER.get_tz_name(116.3883, 39.9289));
    print!("{:?}\n", FINDER.get_tz_names(116.3883, 39.9289));
}
```

For reuse it,
[`racemap/rust-tz-service`](https://github.com/racemap/rust-tz-service) is a
good example.

A Redis protocol demo could be used here:
[redizone](https://github.com/ringsaturn/redizone).

## Performance

The tzf-rs package is intended for high-performance geo spatial query services,
such as weather forecasting APIs. Most queries can be returned within a very
short time, averaging around 3000 nanoseconds(there is 1000ns slower compared
with Go repo `tzf` and I will continue to improve that, you can track progress
[here](https://github.com/ringsaturn/geometry-rs/issues/3)).

Here is what has been done to improve performance:

1. Using pre-indexing to handle most queries takes approximately 1000
   nanoseconds.
2. Using a finely-tuned Ray Casting algorithm package
   [`ringsaturn/geometry-rs`](https://github.com/ringsaturn/geometry-rs) to
   verify whether a polygon contains a point.

That's all. There are no black magic tricks inside the tzf-rs.

Below is a benchmark run on global cities(about 14K), and avg time is about 3000
ns per query:

```txt
test benches_default::bench_default_finder_random_city ... bench:       2,870 ns/iter (+/- 182)
```
